    <h1>CallBack</h1>
    <p>
      Callback hell is a phenomenon where a Callback is called inside another
      Callback. It is the nesting of multiple Callbacks inside a function. If
      you look at the design of the code, it seems just like a pyramid. Thus the
      Callback hell is also referred to as the 'Pyramid of Doom'

    <script>
      api.product(function () {
        api.cart(function () {
          api.payment(function () {
            api.booked(function () {});
          });
        });
      });

      //   This is how it makes pyramid of Doom i.e Callback Hell
